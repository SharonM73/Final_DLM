            But yeah we were going to play Depauw, we drove up all the way to Depauw. We start warming up and I vividly remember talking to Sota like “Yeah Sota I feel really good like we’re going to slap them.” It was just one of those games where you could tell you were gonna have a good game. So we go back to the locker room to change into our game kits, and then they tell us that kid on the other team had COVID, so they just literally canceled the game on the spot. Yeah were so fucking pissed. Yeah we drove all the way there, warmed up, sat in the locker room for a while, then left.        </blockquote>
