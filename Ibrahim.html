        I was in Jordan because the American Embassy was closed and I couldn’t get my VISA. But eventually I got my visa in October. Early October I arrived to the US. It was finals of the first block, and they put me in quarantine for two weeks because that was the protocol for all international travelers at the time. And, I found out that I had covid, so I was in quarantine during finals with covid in a new country alone, so that was a really fun time…. Bad time.
