             <br> Centre College challenges its students to complete a series of general education requirements that it holds as tenets of a liberal arts education. The sequence of Doctrina Lux Mentis courses (DLM)—latin for ‘learning lights the mind’—hones students’ speaking, writing, and collaboration skills, while exploring interdisciplinary fields of inquiry. “Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Cultures of Memory” is a culmination of the college’s general education course sequence and it explores the human characteristics of story-telling and memory. Engaging literature, history, art, religion, sociology, and anthropology, students work together to create their own creative projects, applying collective memory frameworks and knowledge from thinkers across various disciplines.
             <br>
            
           <br> Our group, consisting of Sharon Mega, Monika Jusufovic, Drew Davidson, and Sam Adams, began with the idea to create an oral history of the Fall 2020 semester on campus. Many of us in our fourth year at Centre College, we reflected on our experiences on campus during a global pandemic. Some elements of that semester were extremely challenging, others we reflected on somewhat nostalgically. We were struck, however, with how removed from our current experience at Centre College that semester of lockdowns and quarantines felt. We asked ourselves whether or not people would remember what it was like to live socially distanced, to study asynchronously or remotely, to make new friends on Zoom, on Microsoft Teams, or visit family over Facetime. Out of this, our group project idea was born: We would compile a digital archive about life on campus during the “COVID semesters.” Interviewing students who lived and studied at Centre during the Fall 2020 semester, we would create an oral history, seeking to transmit our experiences in a difficult time for many unto future generations.<br>
            
           <br> We used memory frameworks from Marianne Hirsch and Paul Connerton as the foundation for our project. Marianne Hirsch in her book, Family Frames: Photography, Narrative and Postmemory, describes the unique power photography has to evoke feelings of life and death, appeal universally to viewers, observe details eyewitnesses may not have been able to observe, as well as to include or exclude aspects of real events. Her writing positions photography and drawings as a mediator between the real traumatic experiences of the past and how present individuals and societies remember.<br>
            
            <br>An important term in her writing is postmemory and the discussion around it. As Hirsch understands the term, postmemory is: 
            
            <i>“distinguished from memory by generational distance and from history by deep personal connection. Postmemory is a powerful and very particular form of memory precisely because its connection to its object or source is mediated not through recollection but through an imaginative investment and creation.”</i> <br> 
            
            <br>She goes on to concede that memory itself is also mediated to an extent, but postmemory implies a level of distance removed from the experience, distilled from the unadulterated ‘narratives preceding their birth.’ In this particular case, every one of the participants in our oral history project directly experienced conditions of a socially distanced campus, drawn apart by asynchronous learning and remote instruction. Despite this distinction, there is an element of postmemory to our project. Despite the fact that some of our group members were directly involved on campus during the Fall 2020 semester, others do not remember the stifled first-year experience that characterized the learning of many students during the pandemic. In this regard, photographs and oral testimony can serve as a mediator between the lived experience of those on campus during the most restrictive quarantine period and those who can hardly remember what it was like to live on campus during this time. This project includes photographs and oral testimony which will bridge the gap between future generations of Centre students, and those who experienced campus during the pandemic.<br>
            
            
            <br> This is not to say, however, that the interviews and photographs convey an all-encompassing, objective scope of the student experience on campus, let alone that of staff and of Danville residents in general. As Hirsch elaborates about the photographic lens, it has the ability to emphasize, exacerbate, or include elements that an eyewitness account might have overlooked. Conversely, a camera lens may ignore, crop out, or exclude aspects of the past that were critical to the lived experience of contemporary voices. In the context of our project, we acknowledge that some of the photographs emphasize the mundane, repetitive nature of social distance, while others overlook critical details, such as the preventative measure put in place for safety, regular testing, the resilience of students and staff alike to create a positive and uplifting academic ecosystem at Centre College during a bleak time for most people across the globe.<br>
            
            <br> Our project was also informed by the writing of Paul Connerton, who distinguished between several different types of memory in his book, How Societies Remember. Seeking to contextualize and understand the transmission of cultural practices, knowledge, and indeed memory across generations, Connerton emphasizes the importance of ritual- or habit-memory. This is distinguished from cognitive and individual memory in that habit-memory is ‘inherently performative’ and socially rooted in the past. Connerton uses Maurice Halbwachs’s understanding of collective memory to bolster his description of habit-memory: <br>
            
            <br> <i>“Most frequently, if I recall something that is because others incite me to recall it, because their memory comes to the aid of mine and mine finds support in theirs. Every recollection, however personal it may be, even that of events of which we alone were the witnesses, even that of thoughts and sentiments that remain unexpressed, exists in relationship with a whole ensemble of notions which many others possess: with persons, places, dates, words, forms of language, that is to say with the whole material and moral life of the societies of which we are part or of which we have been part.”<i><br>
            
            <br> As Connerton furthers, the notions that others socially transmit unto us are reinforced in the rituals and experiences we enact. Our perception and memory of the world around us is influenced by a social dynamic preceding our interaction with and interpretation of real events. As elusive and theoretical as this understanding of memory appears to be, it has tangible applications to the development of our project and the creation of a digital oral history of the COVID response at Centre College. As observed in the interview process, there is a social element to remembering the past. Research participants are able to reflect on their own experiences by talking about them with other witnesses to Centre’s COVID response. This interview process enables research participants to negotiate a recollection of the past events that is concordant with their own experiences and reflects the broader understanding of the social setting on campus during the semester in question.<br>
            
            <br> We selected seniors across various groups to be participants in our oral history project because they were on campus with the strictest and most preventative precautionary measures. We interviewed athletes, first generation college students, international students, and students involved in campus Greek Life to contribute to a holistic oral history of Fall 2020 that engages diverse student perspectives. With this convergence of student experiences, we hope to mediate and transmit an understanding of life on Centre’s campus during the school’s response to COVID that can be preserved and reinterpreted with future generations at Centre.<br>
