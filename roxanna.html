        I had no symptoms, and so for me, the fact that I had to wear a mask outside, even though there was no scientific evidence that it could travel more than fifteen feet, made me feel like I had nowhere to escape to without a mask.
        Yeah, so the thing that I remember the most was you have to wear masks at all times other than when you were in your room.
        And this included wearing masks in the hallway before going to brush your teeth or before going to shower, which I also thought was ridiculous because we were in the same area already, and a lot of my dorm mates didn’t follow the rule, so neither did I.
        But the thing that was always upsetting to me was the outdoors, because for me, the outdoors has always been a space where I can be free and liberated from everything.
        And the fact that I couldn’t breathe 100% fresh air because I had a mask on really just made my experience like, wow, even the outdoors.
        I can’t be free from that.
